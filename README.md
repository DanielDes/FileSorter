# FileSorter
This is an Automator workflow which can be attached to a Folder Action, so whenever a new file is added to that Folder the workflow is triggered and the file is then sent to the corresponding subdirectory according to its extention.

This workflow was originally created to sort all downloades files on Downloads folder. It's quite useful if you don't like a messy Download directory and if you want to track a file that you just downloaded.
